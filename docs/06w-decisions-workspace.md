# 06w — Workspace Decision Log (ADR-W)

_Cross-product decisions: ones that belong to **no single product**. Product-specific decisions stay in
[`06-decisions.md`](06-decisions.md) (2-D, `ADR-NNN`) and [`06b-decisions-3d.md`](06b-decisions-3d.md)
(3-D, `ADR-3D-NNN`). Add a new entry (don't rewrite history) when a decision is made or reversed._

**Pre-existing workspace decisions keep their original homes.** Nothing is renumbered or relocated —
see ADR-W-001.

## ADR-W-001 — Establish a workspace-level decision log

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-08)

**Context.** The workspace hosts several products (`src/` 2-D, `src3d/` 3-D, `server/` shared, with
`src-analytic/` and `src-complex/` planned per [docs/22 §9](22-workflow.md)). Decisions belonging to no
single product — the products registry, the isolation rule, deploy topology, documentation structure —
have had no home and landed in whichever product log happened to be open. [ADR-266](06-decisions.md#adr-266),
which establishes the multi-product workspace itself, sits in the **2-D** log.

Numbering was also about to collide: the natural next slot, `06c`, is already allocated to analytic geometry
(`06c-decisions-analytic.md`, ids `ADR-AG-NNN`, [docs/22 §9](22-workflow.md)).

**Decision.** Cross-product decisions are recorded here as `ADR-W-nnn`, in `docs/06w-decisions-workspace.md`
— `06w` for *workspace*, leaving `06c`/`06d` free for the products already registered against them.

**Existing ADRs are never renumbered or relocated.** Over 200 ids are referenced from documentation and code
comments; stable anchors are worth more than tidy filing. ADR-266 keeps its id and its home in the 2-D log.

**Consequences.** A third log to check, offset by a session working in one product no longer having to read
another product's log to learn a workspace rule. New products get an obvious place to register. The
misfiling of ADR-266 is accepted permanently rather than corrected.

## ADR-W-002 — CLAUDE.md is an orientation file, not a session log

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-08) · **Issue:** #452 · **Guards:** `server/__tests__/docs-hygiene.test.ts`

**Context.** `CLAUDE.md` had grown to **192,188 bytes (188 KB)**, of which two sections — `Current state`
(93 KB) and `The 3-D sibling app` (79 KB) — were **90%**. Both were append-only session chronologies:
**95** `**Then (date):**` entries running from 2026-06-15.

Three measurements decided the shape of the fix.

1. **The chronology was redundant.** It referenced **200 distinct ADR ids, all 200 of which resolve** in
   `06-decisions.md` / `06b-decisions-3d.md`. It was a second copy of the ADR logs, ordered by date instead
   of by id, with no anchor and no index — and the one copy that loaded unconditionally into every session.
2. **It was also stale.** Its last update was 2026-07-30; ADR-425, 426, 427, 428 and ADR-3D-111/112 all
   landed afterwards without touching it, while `06-decisions.md` and `DEPLOY-LOG.md` were updated the same
   day. A cold session reading it concluded the project had ended nine days earlier. The ADR logs are the
   only durable record actually kept current.
3. **It regrows fast.** Main line: 135,150 B (2026-07-23) → 192,188 B (2026-07-30) — **+57 KB in seven days,
   ~2 KB per commit.** A 10 KB file returns to 188 KB in roughly three weeks of active work. A one-off
   cleanup without a guard provably evaporates, so **the guard is the deliverable**.

There is a precedent and a warning in this repo's own history: on 2026-07-16 the same operation was performed
on a sibling (*"archive plan status log, replace the 81KB status line with a lean pointer"* →
`docs/09b-status-log.md`). **That file has not been touched since.** Archiving produced a second dead file,
not a maintained one.

**Root cause.** The file had no stated *kind*. Without one, "record what happened" is a locally reasonable act
on every commit, and 95 locally reasonable acts produced 172 KB. Naming the kind makes the pressure visible
at the moment it recurs.

**Decision.**

- **CLAUDE.md is an orientation file**: what exists, where it lives, what must never be done. It carries **no
  history and no status**. The prose is **deleted, not moved** — it is already in the ADR logs, and moving it
  into another session-loaded file (per the 09b precedent) just relocates the problem. Git history is the net.
- **Current state is read from the live sources only**: the ADR-log tails, `gh issue list`, and
  `docs/DEPLOY-LOG.md`. The older narrative logs (`09-implementation-plan.md`, `09b-status-log.md`,
  `PROJECT-MEMORY.md`) are labelled as background that lags, never as current status.
- **The 3-D section moves to `src3d/CLAUDE.md`** — condensed to an orientation file for that tree, not
  relocated verbatim. It is picked up when a session works in `src3d/`, so 2-D sessions stop paying for 3-D
  history, and it matches the product-isolation doctrine already enforced mechanically.
- **Two guards**, in `server/__tests__/` so they run in **every** per-product CI lane (the
  `isolation.test.ts` precedent): a size ceiling with headroom, and a **ban on the dated-chronology form**
  (`**Then (`). The second is the real guard — size creeps back one justified paragraph at a time, but the
  `Then (` form is the specific habit that produced 172 KB, so banning the *form* surfaces the pressure at
  the moment it recurs. A third assertion keeps every ADR id referenced by either file resolvable, so the
  one-off pre-delete verification becomes standing.
- **One fact, one home.** `.claude/memory/` entries that merely restate a CLAUDE.md standing rule are
  retired; memory keeps only what no repo doc carries. Duplicated rules drift, and after they drift nobody
  can tell which copy a session obeyed.

**Consequences.** ~45k tokens of context returned at the head of every session, and — more valuable — the
standing rules stop competing with three months of narrative for attention; previously `no autonomous API
calls` and `triage-first` sat *after* 172 KB of history. Costs: the two CLAUDE.md files must be kept honest
by hand (no mechanism asserts the module map still matches the tree), and a session wanting narrative history
must now go to the ADR logs — which is the intent.

The ceiling is set with headroom rather than at the current size: a guard that fires spuriously gets
relaxed, and then there is no guard at all.
